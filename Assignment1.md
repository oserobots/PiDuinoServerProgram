###What is your team name?
PiDuino Awesomeness
### Who are the members of your team?
Clint Bramlette
Senobio Chavez
### What operating systems concepts do you expect to cover?
Threading
Sockets
Other things (as they occur)
### What is the category of your project? (Create, Examine, Customize, other--explain)
Create
### Explain your project and its goals. It is okay to have some reach goals that you aren't sure if you'll be able to get to.
We desire to connect a Raspberry Pi server to an Arduino and program the Arduino from any client remoteley (via WiFi).
### Why is this project interesting to you?
This will open a can of worms for applying cheap computers to big use.
### Detail a plan for how you will accomplish your goals in a timely fashion.
We are starting early and have already divided some tasks toward our goal (seperate Arduino compiler from IDE, set up RPi as client.)
### What unanswered questions do you still have? (e.g., not sure of all the types of schedulers in Linux, don't yet understand a certain API, not sure how to structure code, etc.)
What is the best way to do this?  How should the file be transferred to RPi and handled?  How do we get compiled code for Arduino without the IDE?
### Who (if anyone) on your team has experience with the target technology, language, or API(s)?
All members have tinker-level experience.  Two have some kind of networking experince and one has in-depth Atmel experience.
### What do you expect to gain from this experience?
Understanding on the capabilities of interfacing and using small-scale cheap computers over a network.
