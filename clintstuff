### Compiling on Windows without the IDE

Typically, compilation is handled by the IDE, which is programmed in Java.  Being able to complile the code is not accessible easily via command line and instead is buried deep in the Java code.  

And no, it's not a very simple process you could easily run in a few command line executions:

Arduino Builder is a standalone application.  It include Arduino Uploader which is a command line utitility that compiles code along the Arduino pipeline.

Then you can compile via the following line:
ArduinoUploader [sketch/HEX file] [board type]
